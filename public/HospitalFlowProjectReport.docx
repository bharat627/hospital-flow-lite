## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Technologies
- **React**: Core library for building the user interface
- **TypeScript**: For type safety across the application
- **React Router**: For navigation and routing
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive styling and UI components
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library for consistent design
- **Recharts**: For data visualization with charts and graphs
- **Lucide React**: For icon components
- **React Query**: For state management and data fetching

### Project Structure
The application is organized into:
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements (Layout, Navbar, Sidebar, etc.)
- **Pages**: Main views of the application (Dashboard, Patients, Medical Records, etc.)
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI components for consistent design
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for shared functionality

### Authentication Flow
The application implements a protected route system using AuthGuard to ensure only authorized users can access certain parts of the application.

### Data Management
